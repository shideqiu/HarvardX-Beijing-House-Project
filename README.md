# Capstone Project: Report on Beijing House
This Project is related to the **IDV Learners Project** of the _HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone Course_. Here, I used a sample of houses sold in Beijing, China from 2011 to 2017 from Kaggle. The dataset was chosen because it has a significant number of features to be explored.

The machine learning algorithms (GLM and SVM) were used to predict the house price in Beijing.
